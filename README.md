❗ Why Air Quality Is a Serious Concern:

*Air pollution is a major public health and environmental issue, especially in rapidly urbanizing regions

*Prolonged exposure to poor air quality increases the risk of asthma, lung diseases, heart conditions, and premature deaths

*Many Indian cities frequently exceed safe AQI limits, making continuous monitoring essential

*Seasonal factors such as winter smog, crop burning, and weather conditions significantly influence AQI levels

*Without proper analysis, raw AQI data does not clearly highlight risk zones, trends, or root causes


🔍 What Was Done in This Analysis:


*Collected and analyzed multi-year AQI data at city and state levels

*Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing, inconsistent, and noisy data

*Created structured datasets optimized for time-series and regional analysis

*Used DAX calculations to derive meaningful KPIs and classification logic

*Applied ranking and comparative analysis to highlight the most polluted regions

*Designed an interactive and filter-driven dashboard for exploratory analysis and insight discovery

*Focused on presenting insights in a clear, decision-ready format


📏 Key Measurements & Metrics Analyzed


*Air Quality Index (AQI) as the primary indicator of pollution severity

*AQI Categories to simplify interpretation for non-technical users

*Average AQI to understand long-term air quality conditions

*Peak (Maximum) AQI to identify extreme pollution events

*Monthly & Seasonal AQI Trends to observe recurring patterns

*Top Polluted Cities and States using AQI-based ranking

*Dominant Pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃) through frequency analysis

*AQI Distribution to assess the proportion of safe vs unsafe air quality levels


🎯 Why These Measurements Are Important:


*Enable early identification of pollution hotspots

*Support comparison across locations and time periods

*Help track seasonal spikes and long-term deterioration

*Provide data-backed insights for public health awareness

*Assist policymakers and planners in targeted pollution control strategies

*Convert complex environmental data into actionable and understandable insights
