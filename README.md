📌 Project Overview

Air pollution has become one of the most critical environmental and public health challenges in modern times.

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data across India to uncover pollution patterns, identify high-risk regions, and highlight the impact of major pollutants.

The dashboard transforms raw AQI data into actionable insights for understanding environmental conditions and public health risks.





❗ Why Air Quality Is a Serious Cause of Concern

Poor air quality directly affects human health, climate, and overall quality of life.

Prolonged exposure to polluted air can lead to severe health complications and long-term environmental damage, especially in urban and industrial regions.

Key Concerns Highlighted by This Project

Health Risks
High AQI levels are linked to respiratory diseases, asthma, lung infections, heart conditions, and reduced life expectancy.

Urban Impact
Major cities and industrial regions frequently fall under Poor and Unhealthy AQI categories, making daily outdoor activities unsafe.

Toxic Pollutants
Fine particulate matter such as PM2.5 and PM10 penetrates deep into the lungs and bloodstream, causing irreversible health damage.

Rising Trends
Seasonal spikes and monthly AQI fluctuations indicate worsening air quality during specific periods.

Vulnerable Populations
Children, elderly individuals, and people with pre-existing health conditions are the most affected by high pollution levels.

This analysis highlights the urgent need for data-driven awareness, continuous monitoring, and policy-level interventions.
